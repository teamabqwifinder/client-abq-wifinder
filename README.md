# Team ABQ WiFinder

### Your aims or motivations for selecting the given topic for your project. That is, why did you choose to develop this particular project, and why is this (at least potentially) a useful or interesting project?

We selected this particular project because of its potential ability to positively effect the developer scene in the local Albuquerque Area. We have seen in the last few years, exponential growth from the tech sector in Albuquerque and the greater region, this is in part because of local entrepreneurs who are putting in the hard work everyday trying to get their ideas off the ground. The purpose of the ABQ WiFinder project is that it will enhance the voice of these entrepreneurs when dealing with local businesses or spaces. Strong developers need good development spaces, places that have a strong wifi connection are essential to these developers and our Application will support this endevour. 

### A “functional inventory” for that repository—i.e. what functional components of the overall project are implemented by code in that repository?

- A login screen powered by Google Sign In
- Several fragments that the user can switch between. 

### TEAM ROSTER

### A description of the current state of completion/readiness of this component, or your project as a whole. This should include a “hit list” of deficiencies: any unimplemented/incomplete elements, and known bugs, that would have to be implemented or corrected for a usable prototype (i.e. one that could be given to a skilled user for testing and feedback), ordered with the most urgent items first.

### A list of platforms (Java versions, Android APIs, OS versions, specific hardware, etc.) on which you’ve tested the submitted version of this component of your project, any hardware/software/orientation restrictions that you’re aware of. (This includes restrictions on device language, orientation, etc.)

### For client side components, a list of aesthetic/cosmetic (not functional) improvements that you think would improve this component. This list should be ordered, with those that would give the most improvement (in your opinion) listed first.

- Ensuring that this application will run on a variety of devices, more field testing. 
- Improving User Navigability and Understanding from the Beginning to End point.
- Allowing Users to become Certified Reviewers.
- Improving the App performance on a variety of hardware. 

### A list of functional stretch goals. These should be sorted either with those that would add the most utility at the top, or with those that would be the simplest to implement at the top.

- Improve User Experience
- Have a fully functioning application
